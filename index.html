                            The Vintage Bar has various platforms and social channels – most
                            notably our Instagram with more than 600k followers – and as a
                            partner on The Vintage Bar your items will be included in the content
                            we produce and showcase on these platforms.
                        </p>
                        <h2>GET BRANDING THROUGH OUR UNIVERSE</h2>
                        <p>
                            We use branding in order to create an inspiring universe for our
                            community and to make secondhand shopping cool and
                            luxurious. As a partner on the platform you’ll be included in this
                            as we’ll promote your boutique and pieces in the same way we do
                            our own.

                        <h2>CONNECTING LOCAL SUPPLY WITH GLOBAL DEMAND</h2>
                        <p>
                            Partnering with a marketplace with a global community that also
                            provides worldwide shipping makes it possible for your boutique to
                            expand and reach new target groups that previously weren’t able to
                            shop with you.
